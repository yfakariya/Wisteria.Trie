## What is it ?

[Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trie) data structure for efficient string look up.

In this context, `string` means an array of `byte` instead of `System.String`, namely `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`.

## Goals

* Provides fast and efficient implementation of reusable trie for:
    * NLP(Natural Language Processing)
    * Member look up for serializer. Some people implement trie as hard coded switch statement (in emitted IL), but I want to use library.


## Usage

T.B.D.
